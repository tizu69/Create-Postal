# Create Postal

A modpack, I guess

## Installation

If you're lazy like me and use Prism, you can get a self-updating pack using
Packwiz. To do so, you can simply do the same thing as with other Packwiz packs.
[Do all the usual](https://packwiz.infra.link/tutorials/installing/packwiz-installer),
and use the following URL: `https://postalpack.tizu.dev/pack.toml`

If you wish to download the pack manually, you may do so by clicking
[this link](https://nightly.link/tizu69/Create-Postal/workflows/pack.yaml/main/pack.zip).

A CurseForge release is in the works, but is not yet available.
